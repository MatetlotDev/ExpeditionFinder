# Expedetion Finder

I do mountaineering for many years now and I hear a lot of people struggling to find a climbing or mountaineering partner.

So the idea is really simple, try to make an application eazy to use, to find people around you that would like to make some mountaineering.

### How does it work ? 

You can simply open the application and look around you, or around a specific place, and see all the people that have posted an idea of expedition.
If no one look interesting for you, then you can add your own expedition and wait for someone to make contact.

### which technos ?

I decided to use for this project Next.js, Node.js and MySQL. Why ? Because I didn't know them before start and I wanted to try them.
